# QtOrm

QtOrm is an unofficial object-relational mapping module for the Qt Framework (http://qt.io).

The current version is a prototype and a proof-of-concept.

## Prerequisites

The QtOrm library is being built on top of Qt 5.12 LTS and requires a C++17-compliant compiler with C++
 standard library support. QtOrm depends on Qt Core and Qt SQL. 

The library is currently being developed and tested with MinGW 7 on Windows 10, other compilers and
platforms might be supported but not guaranteed.

## Installation

* Open qtorm.pro with Qt Creator
* Configure with the required Qt kit (Qt 5.12 at least, C++17-compliant compiler)
* Build 
* Deploy with `make install`

## Current Status

QtOrm currently supports SQLite backend with the following operations:

* Creating database schema according to the registered entities in the OR-mapper
* Reading data from a table, optionally filtered and ordered
* Inserting and/or updating rows
* Removing single rows
* Transaction support
* 1:n, n:1 relations support 

## Usage

### Domain classes 

Domain classes representing table entities must be derived from `QObject`. Class names will be mapped 
to database tables with the same name. All properties declared with `Q_PROPERTY()` will be mapped 
to database columns with the same names.

All mappable properties must be readable, writable, and notifyable. 

Every entity must have proprety `int id`. This property will be set to autogenerated by the 
SQLite backend. 

Every entity must have a default constructor declared with Q_INVOKABLE, otherwise the OR mapper will 
not be able to instantiate it when fetching data. 

All entities must be registered at most once before the first `QOrmSession` instantiation: 

```
qRegisterOrmEntity<Entity1, Entity2, Entity3, ...>();
```

#### Relations 

A 1:n relation can be created by declaring a `QVector` of related entities as follows: 

```
class Town;

class Province : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT 
    
    Q_PROPERTY(int id READ id WRITE setId NOTIFY idChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(QVector<Town*> towns READ towns WRITE setTowns NOTIFY townsChanged)
    
    // the rest of the class skipped
};
```

In this case the property `towns` will be transient and will not be mapped to a database column.
This requires that there is an n:1 back-reference to `Province` in the `Town` entity. When updating 
the reference, keep in mind that change is required on both sides. For example, when adding a Town 
to a Province, add this object to the vector `towns` and set the back-reference of Town to the 
corresponding Province.

An n:1 relation can be created by declaring a pointer to the referenced entity as follows: 

```
class Province; 

class Town : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    
    Q_PROPERTY(int id READ id WRITE setId NOTIFY idChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(Province* province READ province WRITE setProvince NOTIFY provinceChanged)
    
    // the rest of the class skipped
};
```

The SQLite provider maps the property `province` to a database column `province_id` with the column 
type set to the mapped type of `Province::id`. Back-reference in Province is optional. 

### `QOrmSession` 

An instance of `QOrmSession` is the entry point to the OR mapper. All database operations should be 
performed using a single instance of a `QOrmSession`.

An instance of QOrmSession can be configured either by using an instance of `QOrmSessionConfiguration`
or automatically from `qtorm.json` file located either in resources root, working directory, or 
the application executable directory.

#### `qtorm.json` Example

```
{
    "provider": "sqlite",
    "verbose": true, 
    "sqlite": {
        "databaseName": "database.sqlite",
        "schemaMode": "recreate",
        "verbose": true
    }
}
```

Possible values for `schemaMode`: `recreate`, `bypass`.

Any other JSON keys are silently ignored.
